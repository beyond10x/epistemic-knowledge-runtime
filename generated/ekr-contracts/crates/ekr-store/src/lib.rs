//! ekr-store — the `ekr-store` component of `ekr` v1.
//!
//! Persistence through eventlog: content-addressed objects by storage class, and snapshots of committed revisions.
//!
//! The component's outer surface exactly as the specification declares it: accepted commands as
//! handlers, declared views as queries, published events as a typed outbox. The behaviour behind
//! every handler is an implementation obligation — see the `PLAN.md` beside this workspace — and
//! until one is satisfied, its stub answers with a typed refusal naming what is owed.
