epic:run-on-cortex — the old "Filed for the missing rows", "Critical path to cutover" and "Pilot" sections still follow the revised ones, so the body carries two contradictory paths; the stale step 1 still runs the three cb3 stories and `structured-children`, `postgres-run-undo` and `record-field-lookups` in parallel, and the stale table still lists the archived `story:secrets-scan-without-redact`. Round-1 finding 3 therefore holds at the old lines — .engineering/planning/epic/run-on-cortex.md:94-111 (stale step 1 at :104)
epic:run-on-cortex — path step 5 puts `retire-local-redaction` before `retire-ingestion` without naming that `dependency-blocker:ekr-type-packs` blocks it (through `redaction-policy-per-class`). Done-criterion 5 now waits on EKR and ESS type packs, and no step lists that prerequisite — .engineering/planning/epic/run-on-cortex.md:88 (`aep plan artifact graph`: "dependency-blocker:ekr-type-packs" -> "story:retire-local-redaction" blocks)
story:cortex-cutover — path step 4 places `served-channels-by-audience` before the shadow run and cutover, but cutover has no `depends_on` edge to it, so nothing stops the cutover from serving restricted channels (row P3) — .engineering/planning/story/cortex-cutover.md:10-11
upstream-blocker:cortex-org-features — the clearing list names none of the new cortex stories (`structured-children`, `record-field-lookups`, `extraction-supersedes`), though `cortex-instance-spec` needs them for `gitlab_repos` and Slack, so the spec is not gated on them — .engineering/planning/upstream-blocker/cortex-org-features.md:13
upstream-blocker:cortex-release — "every story above" lists no story, and `postgres-run-undo` and `postgres-credential-from-connectors` are named in no cb3 blocker or edge, so cutover is not gated on the PostgreSQL undo that done-criterion 4 relies on — .engineering/planning/upstream-blocker/cortex-release.md:13
story:structured-children — "Left out" sends dropping of refused records to `story:structured-from-files-and-drops`, but that story only supersedes values a source stopped listing (`dropped: Supersede`). cb3's "refused pipelines" are projects GitLab refused (`src/structured.rs:149-153`), so that part of row 17 still has no claimant (round-1 finding 6 only partly resolved) — .engineering/planning/story/structured-children.md:48
story:structured-children — the derived merge-to-first-tag link is "not part of this story" with no owner and no "dropped" decision. cb3 already ships it as `story:merges-linked-to-shipping-tag` (implemented), and the epic table does not record the loss — .engineering/planning/story/structured-children.md:48

**What I read:** 18 artifacts: the initiative, the epic, 6 cb3 stories plus the decision-blocker, 4 cortex stories, 2 EKR stories, and 3 round-1 records (the cortex one in full). I also read the inventory, `structured-from-files-and-drops`, `structured-source`, the cb3 upstream-blockers, `epic:organisation-scale-instance`, and the `aep plan artifact graph` output in all three stores. I read `src/structured.rs:1-12,149-153` as evidence.

**Promise count:** I extracted 15 promises (10 missing rows and 5 done-criteria). All 15 trace to a story or path step, but rows 11, 17 and 6 are narrowed and the narrowing is not fully recorded.

**Round-1 findings:**

| # | finding | state |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | row 29 unclaimed | resolved by `postgres-store-backup` and the epic row |
| 2 | epic capability table | resolved at :20 and :24 |
| 3 | critical path order | open: the new path (:84-88) is right, the old one (:104) remains |
| 4 | served-channels acceptance against revision 547 | resolved by the new acceptance and `pilot-store-restricted-text`, which blocks cutover |
| 5 | row 6 narrowing | resolved by "Left out" |
| 6 | row 17 "refused pipelines" | partial, see the structured-children finding above |

**Not mine to set the verdict:**
- The cortex `release-1-0` and `docs-for-1-0` have no `depends_on` edge to the new stories, so a 1.0 can ship without them (design).
- The new cortex stories still decompose `epic:organisation-scale-instance`, whose table does not list them (design).
- `read-answers-name-types` depends on `read-surface-specified` (blocked on ESS#423), and the epic does not say P1 and P2 are off the cutover path (design).
- The archived `story:secrets-scan-without-redact` has a doubled "Archived" heading (style).

**Could not establish:** whether the `retire-local-redaction` acceptance checks the staged-credential case that stub B1 specified. That is the acceptance critic's lane.
