## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Invariants 1 and 2 are now true.** An independent review found both claimed and carried by
  nothing. Only the kernel reaches a writer to canonical state: the binary no longer declares the
  store, the kernel holds the only public commit path, and the fold learns validation through a
  trait the kernel implements rather than from an event anyone could append. And canonical state
  references by a typed reference rather than a bare identifier, so an edge into the incubation
  forest does not compile (wave p1-06).
- `ekr-store`: a commit validated against a revision the lineage has moved past is refused on
  replay, and a store opened with no commit authority refuses to say what canonical state is
  rather than folding nothing and reporting success (wave p1-06).
- `ekr-kernel`: the integrity membrane. A `GraphTransaction` is a proposal; seven deterministic
  validators turn it into a `ValidatedTransaction`, which only this crate can construct and which
  is the only thing that commits. A transaction is read as a set rather than a sequence, so no
  verdict depends on the order the operations arrive in. A proposal states a claim and never the
  verdict on it (wave p1-05).
- `ekr-store`: persistence through the eventlog. A revision log with a fold, a replay and two
  providers, content-addressed objects that record the strongest retention class ever asked of
  them, and one named crossing into canonical state that reads every field of a document which has
  something to disagree with. The log is synchronous over an asynchronous port (wave p1-05).
- `ekr-graph`: the value a canonical record may carry admits no float, and the graph types are
  generic over the value they hold, so the canonical encoding exists exactly where canonical state
  does and an incubation-forest candidate has no address at all (wave p1-05).
- `ekr-graph`: the graph model. Nodes, edges, bitemporal assertions with their evidence, graph and
  revision roots, and the six-variant revision event vocabulary the kernel publishes and the
  store persists. `GraphSnapshot` answers one read, `valid_at(Timestamp)` — the current-world
  query at the caller's now, the historical query at any other instant, because the runtime has no
  clock. A `Canonical` reference cannot target a transient type: the bound is sealed and three
  `trybuild` cases hold it (wave p1-04).
- `ekr-core`: `Timestamp`, an `i64` millisecond newtype, and `Encoder::variant`, the variant tag a
  sum type carries under the canonical encoding (wave p1-04).
- `ekr-ontology`: the ontology document and its type checker. Node and edge types with parents,
  properties and cardinality; a `ValueType`/`Value` pair that makes `employer = NodeRef(..)`
  checkable and `employer = "OpenAI"` not; per-type lifecycles and named operations. A document
  loads only when every declaration is coherent, and an inherited property is resolved by the
  specialisation order the document declares rather than by distance or by id (wave p1-03).
- `ekr-core`: stable identity (fifteen newtypes, one text form each), content hashing in two
  address domains that cannot collide, and a deterministic canonical encoding the encoder imposes
  rather than the caller (wave p1-02).
- The six P1 crates — `ekr-core`, `ekr-kernel`, `ekr-ontology`, `ekr-graph`, `ekr-store`, `ekr` — as
  empty workspace members in the acyclic order `docs/roadmap.md` § 3 gives, every P1 dependency
  declared, `rust-version` 1.91, and contract tests holding the manifests, the lockfile, README and
  the doc comments to the story (wave p1-01).
- Repository bootstrap: Cargo workspace with `xtask`, the shared source gate, the AEP planning
  store, and the roadmap and predecessor analysis under `docs/`.
- `systems/ekr/`: the runtime's own executable system specification (`ess/1`), four domains —
  kernel, ontology, graph, store — validated by `task spec-check`.
- Design amendments 81–87 to `docs/epistemic-knowledge-runtime-design.md`, carrying what v1
  (`company-brain`) and v2 (`org-brain`) proved necessary: operator surface, projections and views,
  the outward-write invariant, obligations and horizons, the interpretation session contract, blob
  evidence, and per-type lifecycles.
